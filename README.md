# Jagex Account Creator
Utilizes the Python DrissionPage library to automate a Chrome browser and sign up for a new Jagex account.

## Notable features:
* Takes ~15 seconds per account without 2FA enabled. 
* Takes ~30 seconds per account with 2FA enabled.
* Multi-threaded - You can make as many accounts as you want in 15-30 seconds as long as you have computer resources / proxies to handle the threads!
* Supports headless mode.
* ~10MB of data usage pre-cache, 900kb of data usage post-cache!
* * Sets up a local proxy server that intercepts all of the Chrome traffic and blocks requests that aren't required.
* * Elements that can't be blocked are saved to a cache that is shared by all runs and frequently updated.
* Utilizes a catch-all email via imap for easy and quick account verification.
* Supports enabling OTP 2FA on accounts.
* Each successful account creation appends the account and all of the registration info used to `accounts.json`.

## Notable not-features
* If for some reason the creator fails during a run, it likely won't cleanup the temporary run folder it creates.
* * A failed run in headless mode will leave behind a chrome process that you'll need to end.
* If you get a Cloudflare checkbox, your IP is likely temporarily flagged.
* * There is an idea to always check for a Cloudflare checkbox and solve it but it's not implemented as you should be rotating IPs anyways.
* It's possible for the randomly generated username to be `not allowed` by Jagex which will make the creation fail.
* * I feel like I've seen the list of restrictions somewhere when looking at the requests but can't remember.
* * The ideal fix would be to create a username accounting for those restrictions.

## Setup

* Download the repository - https://github.com/gavinnn101/jagex_account_creator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
* * Unzip the download to the location of your choice.
* Open a terminal in the root folder of your download.
* run `pip install -r .\requirements.txt` to install the script dependencies.
* Open `$script_root\src\config.ini` and edit the settings accordingly.
* * You'll need to edit:
* * * `account.domains`
* * * `account.password`
* * * `imap.ip`
* * * `imap.email`
* * * `imap.password`
* Back in your terminal, run `python .\src\main.py`

### IMAP / Domains Explanation
Your `imap.email` should have a catch-all alias pointing to it for all domains listed under `account.domains`
```
[accounts]
domains = mydomain1.com,myotherdomain.net

[imap]
email = catchAll@mydomain.com

> Account creator tries to make abcd123@mydomain1.com
> Account creator signs into catchAll@mydomain.com via imap and waits for an email addressed to abcd123@mydomain1.com.

> Account creator tries to make abcd123@myotherdomain.net
> Account creator signs into catchAll@mydomain.com via imap and waits for an email addressed to abcd123@myotherdomain.net.
```
